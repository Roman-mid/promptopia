What if all your best AI prompts were always at your fingertips?

I’ve built a small project that solves exactly this — a simple and convenient platform for storing and sharing AI prompts.

Core features:
 - Create and save prompts with hashtags for easy categorization
 - Edit and delete your own prompts in a personal dashboard
 - Browse prompts from the entire community
 - Search by text, hashtags, or author name
 - View a dedicated page with all prompts from a specific user

Tech stack:
 Next.js · OAuth 2.0 · MongoDB Atlas · JavaScript · Tailwind CSS

 Create a few prompts and let me know what you think in the comments.
 If you spot any bugs — share them too, and I’ll fix them!
